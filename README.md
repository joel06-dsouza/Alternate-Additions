# Alternate-Additions

Problem Code: ALTERADD

Chef has 2 numbers A and B (A<B).

Chef will perform some operations on A.

In the ith operation:

Chef will add 1 to A if i is odd.
Chef will add 2 to A if i is even.
Chef can stop at any instant. Can Chef make A equal to B?

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers A and B.


Output Format

For each test case, output YES if Chef can make A and B equal, NO otherwise.

Note that the checker is case-insensitive. So, YES, Yes, yEs are all considered same.
